Application of BabelNet and BabelFly API to movie subtitles annotation

 build_sense_trees.py  - is a python script to build sense trees :-)
 display_sense_tree.py - is a python script to display those sense trees :-)
 
# set up

So far, those scripts are only building sense trees with synsets as nodes. To run it you should obtain an API key by Creating a BabelNet account.

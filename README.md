# Whose line is it anyway?
## Automatic Multilingual Emotion Annotation of Movie Dialogues

Repository for lightning talk given at "The Luxembourg BabelNet Workshop, 2-3 March 2016, Luxembourg".
As a teaser, please read the abstract from work:

> In this work we take advantage of both semantic networks provided by BabelNet  and distributed word representations trained by skip-gram model with negative sampling to obtain vector representations of 8 emotional states. We used those emotion vectors to identify emotional scenes in several contemporary movies spanning different genres and two languages (Polish and English).

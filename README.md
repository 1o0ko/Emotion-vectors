# Whose line is it anyway?
## Automatic Multilingual Emotion Annotation of Movie Dialogues

Repository for lightning talk given at "The Luxembourg BabelNet Workshop, 2-3 March 2016, Luxembourg".
As a teaser, please read the abstract from work:

> In this work we take advantage of both semantic networks provided by BabelNet  and distributed word representations trained by skip-gram model with negative sampling to obtain vector representations of 8 emotional states. We used those emotion vectors to identify emotional scenes in several contemporary movies spanning different genres and two languages (Polish and English). \\ 

Application of BabelNet and BabelFly API to movie subtitles annotation

* build_sense_trees.py  - is a python script to build sense trees :-)
* display_sense_tree.py - is a python script to display those sense trees :-)
 
# How to set it up?
To run it you should obtain an API key by Creating a BabelNet account.
